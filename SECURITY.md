# Security Checklist for Leave Manager

## ✅ Environment Variables Protection

Your `.gitignore` file is properly configured to exclude:
- `.env*` files (all environment variable files)
- `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`
- Security certificates and keys (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.crt`, etc.)
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
- Log files that might contain sensitive information

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ `.env.local` is properly ignored by git
- ✅ No sensitive data is committed to the repository
- ✅ Use `.env.example` to document required variables

### 2. Database Security
- ✅ MongoDB connection string is not in the repository
- ✅ Database credentials are stored in environment variables
- ✅ IP whitelisting configured for production

### 3. Authentication Security
- ✅ JWT secrets are stored in environment variables
- ✅ Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- ✅ Token-based authentication with expiration

### 4. API Security
- ✅ Input validation on all API endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Team isolation (users can only access their team's data)
- ✅ SQL injection protection (using MongoDB with proper queries)

### 5. Frontend Security
- ✅ Client-side validation with server-side verification
- ✅ Protected routes with authentication checks
- ✅ Secure token storage in localStorage
- ✅ XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. **Environment Variables**: Set in Vercel dashboard, not in code
2. **HTTPS**: Automatically provided by Vercel
3. **Domain Security**: Use Vercel's provided domain or custom domain with SSL
4. **Database Access**: Whitelist Vercel's IP ranges in MongoDB Atlas

### Required Environment Variables for Production:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/leave-manager
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
```

## 🔍 Security Audit Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] No secrets are committed to git repository
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes Vercel IPs (0.0.0.0/0 for simplicity)
- [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Input validation is working on all forms
- [ ] Authentication is required for all protected routes
- [ ] Team data isolation is working correctly

## 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

### Database Security:
- Use MongoDB Atlas built-in security features
- Enable database auditing if needed
- Regular security updates for dependencies

### Application Security:
- Regular dependency updates
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Use Vercel's security headers
- Implement rate limiting if needed

### Monitoring:
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track unusual API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for security events

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Security Test

1. **Test Authentication**: Verify login/logout works correctly
2. **Test Authorization**: Ensure users can only access their team's data
3. **Test Input Validation**: Try submitting invalid data
4. **Test API Security**: Verify API endpoints require authentication
5. **Test Environment Variables**: Ensure no secrets are exposed in client-side code

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate JWT secrets
   - Review access logs
   - Check for unauthorized data access

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review MongoDB Atlas logs
   - Check Vercel function logs
   - Analyze user activity patterns

3. **Recovery**:
   - Update all secrets
   - Patch any vulnerabilities
   - Notify affected users if necessary
